# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Overview

This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning models. The dataset is preprocessed, models are trained, and their performance is evaluated using various metrics. The primary goal is to build and compare multiple models to determine the most effective one for survival prediction.

## Models Implemented

- **Logistic Regression**: A simple model used for binary classification tasks, predicting survival based on various features.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: A robust ensemble learning model that uses multiple decision trees to make predictions.
- **Neural Network (TensorFlow)**: A deep learning model built using TensorFlow and Keras, trained to predict survival based on the dataset.
